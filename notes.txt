Expose via window.consentua

Supply:
- information about current request
-- template
-- current token (if any); else some kind of "null" token
-- user? like what? just the UID in case they want to look stuff up?

Receive:
- consent granted; plus information about WHAT, as a js object
- interaction aborted



== Web Mode ==

In web mode we load the interaction in an iframe.

We might use nested iframes?

Calling App [Untrusted, off-domain]
  -> Consentua wrapper [Trusted, websdk.consentua.com] : Talk to consentua service, load appropriate interaction
    -> Interaction [Semi-trusted, client-xxx.consentua.com] : Display interaction, talk to parent frame through window.postMessage

MAIN APP
  -> CLIENTXXX.CONSENTUA.COM/UI/XXX/

Interaction is by way of window.postMessage

== Interaction Anatomy ==

Interactions must have:
* main.html: This HTML file is loaded into the iframe/webview
